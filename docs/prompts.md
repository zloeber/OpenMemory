## Prompts


- Review this project and look for architectural patterns for optimization at scale such as as a SaaS service.
- Create the metrics api backend endpoint that returns engine statistics and other useful data such as embedding calls, namespace counts, and more.
- Create a bootstrap script that automatically loads up a realistic sequence of memories for a made up situation using the API. Do this twice and load memories for 2 separate namespaces/agents that you will also register.
